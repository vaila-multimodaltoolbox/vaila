# Skill Registry

This skill provides instructions for interacting with the **Skill Registry** on
the Gemini Enterprise Agent Platform.

## Core Capabilities

-   **Skill Discovery** - Query the registry to easily search, list, get
    specific skills, and inspect revision histories.
-   **Skill Lifecycle Management** - Upload, update, or permanently delete
    skills.
-   **Operation Monitoring** - Utility to check the completion status of
    long-running state changes (LROs).
-   **Generate Skill** - Automate the initial scaffolding of new agent skills
    locally.

## Core Directives

-   **Mandatory Validation**: ALWAYS execute the environment validation check
    before performing any operations.

    Before any operation, you **must** validate the core environment.

    ```bash
    # Execute the validation script
    python3 scripts/validate_env.py
    ```

## Prerequisites & Authentication

```

### Environment Variables
