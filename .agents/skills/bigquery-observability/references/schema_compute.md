## View Scoping & Qualification Matrix

BigQuery Compute and Capacity views are **Region-Only** scoped. They require the
`region-{region}` dataset qualifier (e.g. ``
`{project_id}`.`region-{region}`.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.{view_name}``) and cannot be
scoped to a single dataset:

#### Nested `per_second_details` Schema (Field in `RESERVATIONS_TIMELINE`)

The `per_second_details` column is an `ARRAY<STRUCT>` providing 1-second
discrete capacity and usage snapshots within the 1-minute period:

*   `start_time` (`TIMESTAMP`): The exact UTC timestamp of the second.
*   `autoscale_current_slots` (`INT64`): Autoscaling slots available to the
    reservation at this second (excludes baseline slots). Reflects accurate
    second-by-second scaling when autoscaler adjusts multiple times within a
    minute.
*   `autoscale_max_slots` (`INT64`): Maximum autoscaling slots configured at
    this second (excludes baseline slots).
*   `slots_assigned` (`INT64`): Baseline slot capacity assigned to this
    reservation at this second.
*   `slots_max_assigned` (`INT64`): Maximum slot capacity including idle slot
    sharing (`slots_assigned` if `ignore_idle_slots = TRUE`).
*   `borrowed_slots` (`INT64`): Number of slots consumed from the shared idle
    slot pool. Populated only when `ignore_idle_slots = FALSE` and idle slots
    were used during this second.
*   `lent_slots` (`INT64`): Number of baseline slots borrowed by other
    reservations from this reservation's baseline pool. Populated only when
    `ignore_idle_slots = FALSE` and idle slots were shared during this second.

> [!NOTE] **Array Population Invariant:** When there are autoscale or
> reservation changes during the minute, `per_second_details` is populated with
> 60 elements (one per second). For steady-state reservations with no changes
> during that minute, `per_second_details` is an empty array to prevent
> redundant repeating data. To analyze second-level telemetry, use `LEFT JOIN
> UNNEST(per_second_details) AS s`.
