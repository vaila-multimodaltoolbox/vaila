# Validate Google Mobile Ads SDK Integration

Validate a project's Google Mobile Ads (GMA) SDK integration either as a
complete audit or for specific requested checks.

-   **Full Audit**: If the user requests a general validation or full audit,
    evaluate all checklist items.
-   **Specific Checks**: If the user asks to validate only a specific area
    (e.g., ad preloading), evaluate only the relevant check(s) without running
    the entire checklist.

## Scoring Rules

For each check, apply one of the following statuses:

-   **Pass**: None of the Warning, Fail, or N/A criteria are met.
-   **Warning**, **Fail**, or **N/A**: The conditions described under each
    respective status are met.

## Validation Checklist

Read the reference guide for each check to be performed:

-   No test application ID is in the project, format correct:
    `references/application-id.md`
-   No test ad units are in the project, format correct:
    `references/ad-units.md`
-   Implemented all Google SKAdNetwork IDs:
    `references/google-skadnetwork-ids.md`
-   Mediation adapter compatibility:
    `references/mediation-adapter-compatibility.md`
-   Ad preloading validation checks: `references/ad-preloading.md`

Generate a Markdown report following the format below. **ONLY** include the
findings for items that were actually checked.
