# Agent Platform Supported Models and Recommendations

This reference catalog provides technical specifications, tuning
recommendations, and deployment hardware requirements for supported models in
Agent Platform.

## Supported Models Catalog

> [!WARNING] **CRITICAL AGENT INSTRUCTION**
> Do NOT use this catalog to recommend a specific model to the user until they
> have explicitly confirmed their **Model Category** as Open Model.
> Furthermore, do NOT recommend any model that is not explicitly listed in this
> catalog, as the tuning service does not support it.
> When a user asks for a model that is not listed, do not stop at refusing it.
> Say it is not supported for tuning, then offer the closest model that is
> listed, preferring the same family and the nearest size, and let the user
> decide. A model missing from this catalog is usually a release that is newer
> than the tuning service supports, so the previous release of that same family
> is normally the right suggestion.

Available open models can be found in Google Cloud [documentation](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/tuning/open-model-tuning.md.txt).
This is the list of open models that are available for tuning; do not suggest
any other open models besides the one listed here.
Each model has some [limitations](https://docs.cloud.google.com/gemini-enterprise-agent-platform/models/tuning/open-model-tuning.md.txt) for tuning.

## Model Resource Name Format

The names in the **Model** column below are display names. The tuning API does
not accept them. `--base_model` requires a publisher model **resource name**,
listed in the **Resource name** column of the table in
[Baseline Hyperparameter Recommendations](#baseline-hyperparameter-recommendations):

```
{publisher}/{model_id}@{version_id}
```

The longer form `publishers/{publisher}/models/{model_id}@{version_id}` is also
accepted.

> [!WARNING] Copy the resource name from the table; **do not construct it**.
> The `@{version_id}` suffix is mandatory, `{model_id}` is the *family*
> (`gemma3`, `qwen3`) rather than the variant, and the publisher is lowercase.
> Omitting the suffix is the single most common cause of
> `INVALID_ARGUMENT: Invalid open source publisher model resource name`;
> `google/gemma-3-4b-it` and `Qwen/Qwen3-8B` are both rejected.

The family segment cannot be derived from the display name:

- `meta/llama3_1` uses an underscore, but `meta/llama3-2` and `meta/llama3-3`
  use hyphens.
- Qwen 3.5 9B is `qwen/qwen3-5@qwen3.5-9b` -- hyphen in the family, dot in the
  version.
- Medgemma 1.5 4B IT is `google/medgemma@medgemma-1.5-4b-it`; the version, not
  the family, carries the `1.5`.

This format applies to `--base_model` for supervised tuning. Distillation
teacher models use a different, unversioned form, such as
`qwen/qwen3-next-80b-a3b-thinking-maas`.

## Model Selection Guidelines

**Identify Task**: Check a few samples from the dataset to identify the task.

Choose a model family based on your task type:

- **Qwen**: Best for code generation or complex math-based tasks.
- **Gemma**: Optimized for chat-based interactions, creative writing and multilingual tasks.
- **Llama (Instruct)**: Strong general-purpose chat/instruction models.
- **Llama (Base/Scout)**: Best for continuation tasks or building custom instruction-tuned models.

**Complexity Heuristics**:

- **Simple (QA, Extraction)**: 1B - 3B models.
- **Intermediate (Summarization, Reasoning)**: 8B - 17B models.
- **Complex (Multi-turn, Tool use, Deep reasoning)**: 27B - 70B models.

## Baseline Hyperparameter Recommendations

These values are starting points and should be adjusted based on your dataset
size.

The **Resource name** column is the exact value to pass to `--base_model`.
