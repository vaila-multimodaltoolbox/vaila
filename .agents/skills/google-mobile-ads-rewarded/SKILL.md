# Google Mobile Ads SDK - Rewarded Ads

Rewarded ads reward users with in-app items for interacting with full-screen
ads. Rewarded ads are served after a user explicitly opts in to view a rewarded
ad.

## Workflow

1.  **Determine the user's platform**: Identify if the project is Android,
    iOS, or Unity. If unclear, ask before proceeding.

2.  **Read the platform guide** for implementation details:
    -   Android: `references/android-rewarded.md`
    -   iOS: `references/ios-rewarded.md`
    -   Unity: `references/unity-rewarded.md`

3.  **Follow these steps in order**:
    -   [ ] Load the ad
    -   [ ] Register for ad event callbacks
    -   [ ] Add a UI element to view the ad for a reward
    -   [ ] Show the ad
    -   [ ] Verify the implementation
