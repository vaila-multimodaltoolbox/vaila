# Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework skill for the Sustainability pillar

## Overview

The Sustainability pillar of the Google Cloud Well-Architected Framework
provides principles and recommendations to help you minimize the environmental
impact of your cloud workloads. It focuses on a shared responsibility
model—Google optimizes the sustainability *of* the cloud, while customers
optimize sustainability *in* the cloud. By making informed decisions about
architecture, resource allocation, and region selection, you can significantly
reduce your carbon footprint and improve overall energy efficiency.

## Core principles

The recommendations in the sustainability pillar of the Well-Architected
Framework are aligned with the following core principles:

-   **Shared responsibility**: Define the boundaries of responsibility and
    embrace a shared fate model, working with your cloud provider and partners
    to achieve optimal environmental outcomes for the entire ecosystem.
    Grounding document:
    https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/sustainability.md.txt

-   **Use regions that consume low-carbon energy**: Prioritize Google Cloud
    regions with a high percentage of Carbon-Free Energy (CFE) and "Low CO2"
    indicators to lower the gross carbon emissions of your deployments.
    Grounding document:
    https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/sustainability/low-carbon-regions.md.txt

-   **Optimize AI and ML workloads**: Maximize computations per watt by matching
    algorithmic needs to specialized hardware (like TPUs) and applying
    mathematical techniques to reduce computational complexity. Grounding
    document:
    https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/sustainability/ai-ml-energy-efficiency.md.txt

-   **Optimize resource usage**: Eliminate energy waste by scaling resources to
    zero when idle, rightsizing virtual machines, and prioritizing managed
    services that dynamically match actual demand. Grounding document:
    https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/sustainability/optimize-resource-usage.md.txt

-   **Develop energy-efficient software**: Design your applications to minimize
    unnecessary CPU, memory, and network activity on both backend servers and
    end-user devices by using event-driven logic and optimized assets. Grounding
    document:
    https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/sustainability/energy-efficient-software.md.txt

-   **Optimize data and storage**: Reduce the environmental footprint of your
    storage by implementing lifecycle management to archive cold data and
    eliminating "dark data" that provides no business value. Grounding document:
    https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/sustainability/optimize-storage.md.txt

-   **Continuously measure and improve**: Gain visibility into your carbon
    emissions by analyzing granular data, identifying hotspots, and taking
    proactive steps to remediate inefficiencies. Grounding document:
    https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/sustainability/continuously-measure-improve.md.txt

-   **Promote a culture of sustainability**: Embed sustainability into your
    organizational governance, connect technical decisions to environmental
    goals, and ensure staff have the skills to implement green practices.
    Grounding document:
    https://docs.cloud.google.com/architecture/framework/sustainability/culture.md.txt

-   **Align sustainability practices with industry guidelines**: Ensure that
    your sustainability initiatives are aligned with industry guidelines for
    measurement, reporting, and verification, such as W3C Web Sustainability
    Guidelines, Green Software Foundation, and Greenhouse Gas Protocol.

        reduction targets, or verified Carbon Footprint data from BigQuery
        supports formal ESG disclosures.
    -   [ ] Applications are instrumented to measure the specific carbon
        intensity of software features, or automated exports of Carbon Footprint
        data to BigQuery are configured for deep analysis.
