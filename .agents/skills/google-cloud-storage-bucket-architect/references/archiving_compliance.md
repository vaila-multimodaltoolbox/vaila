# Long-Term Archive & Regulatory Compliance

This reference document outlines the secure-by-default, cost-effective
configuration mapping and architecture recommendation for Cloud Storage buckets
optimized for long-term archiving and regulatory compliance mandates.

## Description

The user is retaining data (such as financial statements, medical records, tax
documents, or corporate legal logs) for legal or regulatory requirements
(typically 7-10+ years). The data is accessed very infrequently, but its
integrity must be guaranteed, and it must be protected against accidental or
premature deletion (immutability).

## Bucket Configuration Plan Mapping

The following table maps the Long-Term Archive & Compliance use case to specific
Cloud Storage features and details their recommendation status.

**Core**       | **Storage Class**                      | Highly Recommended | **Coldline** or **Archive** Storage Class.<br><br>Archive storage offers the lowest cost per gigabyte, ideal for data kept as a legal requirement that may never be read. Beware of high retrieval and early deletion fees (e.g. minimum 365 days retention for Archive).                        | [Storage Classes](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/storage-classes)
               | **Bucket Type**                        | Highly Recommended | **Regional** or **Dual-Regional** bucket configuration. Multi-regional configurations should be avoided if national laws mandate physical data residency boundaries.                                                                                                                             | [Locations](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/locations)
**Serving**    | **Signed URLs**                        | Good to Have       | Gated write access only; restrict public URLs entirely.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | [Signed URLs](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/access-control/signed-urls)

               | **Public Access Prevention (PAP)**     | **Required**       | **Must be enforced.** Disallows public read permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | [Public Access Prevention](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/public-access-prevention)
               | **Encryption (CMEK)**                  | Highly Recommended | **CMEK via KMS** is standard for compliance workloads. Use KMS Autokey for automated keys, or prompt the user for key paths.                                                                                                                                                                     | [CMEK](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/encryption/customer-managed-keys)
               | **IP Filtering**                       | Good to Have       | Limit bucket administration endpoints exclusively to verified corporate office IPs or secure VPN ranges.                                                                                                                                                                                         | [Bucket IP Filtering](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/ip-filtering-overview)
               | **Retention Policy (WORM)**            | Good to Have       | Configure Cloud Storage **Bucket Lock** or **Object Lock** to enforce immutability (Write Once, Read Many).<br><br>**Warning: Locking the retention policy is irreversible. Objects cannot be deleted by anyone, including owners or Google Cloud Support, until the retention period expires.** | [Bucket Lock](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/bucket-lock)<br>[Object Lock](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/object-lock)
**Cost**       | **Object Lifecycle Management (OLM)**  | Highly Recommended | Configure lifecycle rules to automatically purge expired archive records (e.g. delete after 7 years / 2555 days) to mitigate liability and storage costs.                                                                                                                                        | [Lifecycle Management](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/lifecycle)
**Management** | **Labels & Tagging**                   | Highly Recommended | Apply governance metadata tags (e.g. `{"compliance-type": "hipaa"}` or `{"retention-period": "7-years"}`) for cost-center and policy tracking.                                                                                                                                                   | [Bucket Labels](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/using-bucket-labels)

## Key Pre-Deployment Questions to Ask:

1.  **What specific compliance standard governs this data (e.g., HIPAA, SEC Rule
    17a-4, GDPR)?**
2.  **Do you require an irreversible compliance lock (Bucket/Object Lock)?**
    *   *If Yes*: Explain that once locked, even the Project Administrator
        cannot shorten the policy or delete the data. Confirm if they wish to
        proceed with "Locked" or "Unlocked" status.
3.  **What is the exact data retention duration (e.g., 7 years)?**
