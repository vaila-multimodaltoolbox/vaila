# AI & Machine Learning (Storage for AI)

This reference document outlines the configuration mapping and architecture
recommendation for Cloud Storage buckets optimized for AI/ML workloads,
including model training, checkpointing, and model inference.

## Description

The user is running demanding AI/ML workloads (such as Large Language Model
training, computer vision pipelines, or high-throughput batch inference)
utilizing TPU or GPU accelerators. These workloads require ultra-high read/write
throughput, sub-millisecond latencies, and co-location with compute resources to
prevent compute starvation.

## Architecture Alternatives: Rapid Cache vs. Zonal Buckets (Rapid Bucket)

Depending on the specific workload phase (Training, Checkpointing, or Inference)
and data access patterns, recommend one of the two Cloud Storage Rapid
solutions. Per the
[Rapid Bucket Terminology](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/rapid/rapid-bucket#terminology),
**Rapid Bucket** is the product that enables buckets to be created with a zonal
location and the **Rapid storage class**, while individual buckets are referred
to as **zonal buckets**.

Dimension                  | Rapid Cache                                                                                                                    | Zonal Buckets (Rapid Bucket)
:------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :---------------------------
**Description**            | SSD-backed zonal read cache attached to an existing Cloud Storage bucket (regional, dual-regional, or multi-regional).         | Zonal bucket in the `RAPID` storage class.
**Primary Use Case**       | **Model Training & Inference** where datasets already exist in a Cloud Storage bucket.                                         | **Model Checkpointing** and high-QPS, write-heavy training tasks.
**Read/Write**             | **Read-Only**. Writes must be written to the underlying bucket.                                                                | **Read and Write**. Serves as a writable source of truth.
**Namespace**              | Same namespace as the underlying Cloud Storage bucket.                                                                         | Independent namespace (must copy/upload data directly).
**Performance**            | High throughput. Initial read cold-start penalty can be avoided using **ingest-on-write**. Same QPS as standard Cloud Storage. | Ultra-low latency, high throughput, and high QPS (no cold start).
**Data Lifecycle**         | Default TTL is 24 hours. Cache automatically evicts stale data.                                                                | Permanent storage (data lives forever until deleted).
**Appendability**          | No append support.                                                                                                             | **Supports Append (BiDi protocol)** to write streaming data up to 5TiB.
**Hierarchical Namespace** | Optional.                                                                                                                      | **Required** (Always enabled, not configurable).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Rapid Cache Specific Recommendations

When the architecture plan recommends **Rapid Cache**, the agent MUST explicitly
configure and recommend the following:

1.  **Zonal Co-location**: Co-locate the Rapid Cache instance in the exact same
    zone as the compute cluster (e.g. GPU/TPU cluster).
2.  **Ingest-on-Write (Recommended to Avoid Cold Start)**: Enable
    [ingest-on-write](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/rapid/rapid-cache#ingest-on-write)
    (at bucket-level or prefix/managed folder level) so that newly written data
    is immediately ingested into the cache upon write. This eliminates initial
    cache misses and avoids cold-start penalties for read-after-write workloads.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Zonal Buckets (Rapid Bucket) Specific Recommendations

When the architecture plan recommends **Zonal Buckets (Rapid Bucket)**, the
agent MUST explicitly configure and recommend the following:

1.  **Zonal Co-location**: Co-locate the zonal bucket in the exact same zone as
    the compute/training nodes (e.g. `us-east4-a` for GPU cluster in
    `us-east4-a`) to eliminate network bottlenecks.
2.  **Storage Class**: The storage class MUST be set to `RAPID`.
3.  **Disable Soft Delete**: Soft delete is not supported for zonal buckets and
    MUST be disabled (set `--soft-delete-duration=0` during creation).
4.  **Hierarchical Namespace**: Hierarchical Namespace MUST be enabled.
5.  **BiDi Protocol Recommendation**: For streaming, write-heavy, or logging
    workloads, explicitly recommend utilizing the **BiDi protocol**
    (Bidirectional Streaming) on the zonal bucket to enable low-latency,
    high-QPS streaming append operations up to 5TiB.

## Key Pre-Deployment Questions to Ask:

1.  **What phase of the AI/ML pipeline is this storage for?**
    *   *If Training / Inference (read-heavy)*: Ask if the dataset already
        exists. Recommend **Rapid Cache** to save migration time and egress
        costs.
    *   *If Checkpointing (write-heavy)*: Recommend **zonal buckets** (with
        Rapid Bucket) for low-latency writes.
2.  **What zone is your compute cluster (TPU/GPU) located in?**
    *   *Recommendation*: Co-locate the Rapid Cache or zonal bucket in the exact
        same zone (e.g. `us-central1-a`) to eliminate network bottlenecks.
3.  **If using Rapid Cache, do you want to enable ingest-on-write?**
    *   *Recommendation*: Enable ingest-on-write so that data is ingested into
        the cache upon write, eliminating initial cache misses and cold-start
        penalties.
