# Google Cloud Recipe: Foundation Builder

> [!WARNING] This skill is currently in a preview state. It will deploy a secure
> foundation, but does not have all advanced features. Users who want more

> [Google Cloud Setup](https://docs.cloud.google.com/docs/enterprise/cloud-setup).

This skill guides the setup of a secure, enterprise-grade Google Cloud landing
zone foundation. It establishes baseline security controls, organizes the
initial resource hierarchy, and configures centralized audit logging and
cross-environment monitoring.

## Overview

The recipe provisions the following core components at the organization root:

*   **Security Guardrails**: Enforces 17 baseline Google Cloud Organization
    Policies to secure the environment (13 Boolean, 4 List constraints).
*   **Resource Hierarchy**: Establishes 4 folders (`Common`, `Production`,
    `Non-Production`, `Development`) and provisions corresponding projects
    sequentially with globally unique ID prefixes (`logging-`, `prod-`,
    `non-prod-`, `dev-` followed by a shared suffix).
*   **Billing & API Enablement**: Links all projects to your billing account and
    activates critical logging/monitoring services.
*   **Centralized Logging & Monitoring**: Deploys a global, centralized log
    bucket with 30-day retention, configures an organization-wide audit log
    sink, and sets up a cross-environment metrics scope.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Clarifying Questions

Before executing this recipe, the agent **must** gather the following details:

1.  **Organization ID**: Run `gcloud organizations list` to retrieve the
    available organizations, present them to the user, and ask them to select
    the target **Organization ID**.
2.  **Billing Account ID**: Run `gcloud billing accounts list
    --filter=open=true` to retrieve only the active (open) billing accounts,
    present them to the user, and ask them to select the active **Billing
    Account ID**.
3.  **Project ID Suffix**: Ask if the user has a preferred prefix or target
    suffix for Project IDs (default uses prefix + a shared random 8-character
    string, e.g., `prod-ab12cd34`).
4.  **Log Bucket Region**: Ask for the target region for resources if they want
    to override the default `global` log bucket location.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Prerequisites

Ensure the following prerequisites are met before beginning the deployment:

*   **GCP Identity**: You must have a Google Cloud Organization resource set up.
*   **Administrative IAM Roles**: The identity executing these commands must
    hold the required administrative permissions. If any step fails with a
    `Permission Denied` error, the agent will attempt to self-remediate by
    granting the corresponding recommended role as detailed in **Phase 2: Error
    Recovery & Lazy Role Remediation Strategy**.
*   **Tools**: The `gcloud` CLI must be installed, authorized with the above
    identity, and configured for use.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Steps to Complete the Recipe

### Phase 1: Pre-flight Confirmation

Identify the target organization and obtain explicit user approval before making
changes.

1.  **Identify and Discover Organization**: Verify the target organization. If
    only the display name is known, list organizations to find the ID. Then,
    retrieve the organization metadata to dynamically calculate the **Directory
    Customer ID** and **Domain Name**:

    ```bash
    # List to find ID if needed
    gcloud organizations list

    # Describe the organization to retrieve metadata
    gcloud organizations describe [ORGANIZATION_ID]
    ```

    *Calculate values:*

    *   **Domain Name** (`[ORG_NAME]` / `[YOUR_DOMAIN]`): Use the `displayName`
        value from the output (e.g., `my-business.com`).
    *   **Customer ID** (`[DIRECTORY_CUSTOMER_ID]`): Use the
        `owner.directoryCustomerId` value from the output (e.g., `C01234567`).

2.  **Present Blueprint Summary**: Present the exact details of the blueprint to
    the user and request confirmation to proceed:

    > **Proposed Foundation Deployment Summary for Organization: `[ORG_NAME]`
    > (`[ORGANIZATION_ID]`)**
    >
    > *   **Security:** Enforce 17 baseline Organization Policies (13 Boolean, 4
    >     List).
    > *   **Folders:** Create 4 folders sequentially (`Common`, `Production`,
    >     `Non-Production`, `Development`).
    > *   **Projects:** Create 4 projects sequentially with unique IDs
    >     (`logging-[SUFFIX]`, `prod-[SUFFIX]`, `non-prod-[SUFFIX]`,
    >     `dev-[SUFFIX]`).
    > *   **Billing:** Link all projects to Billing Account
    >     `[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]`.
    > *   **APIs:** Enable Logging and Monitoring APIs on the central project.
    > *   **Centralized Logging:** Deploy a `global` log bucket
    >     `[ORG_NAME]-logging` (30-day retention), configure an
    >     organization-level sink
    >     `[ORGANIZATION_ID]-logbucketsink-[RANDOM_HEX]`, and establish
    >     cross-project metrics scopes.
    >
    > Do you wish to proceed with this deployment? (Yes/No)

> [!IMPORTANT] **Pause execution** and wait for explicit user approval before
> moving to Phase 2. If the user declines, abort the operation.

### Phase 2: Error Recovery & Lazy Role Remediation Strategy

To ensure deployment continues smoothly on clean organizations without requiring
complex upfront permission checks (which require a quota project), the agent
**must** adopt a "lazy recovery" approach.

Instead of testing permissions in advance, the agent will attempt to execute
each step in the recipe. If a step fails with a `Permission Denied` error, the
agent will attempt to self-remediate by granting the corresponding recommended
administrative group of roles to the deployment identity and retrying the
operation.

> [!IMPORTANT] When asked about pre-deployment readiness, prerequisites, or
> checks to run, the agent **must** explicitly explain that the landing zone
> deployment adopts a lazy role remediation strategy rather than upfront
> testing, detailing all of the following in its response: 1. Confirm it will
> execute deployment commands directly, catching any Permission Denied
> errors. 2. Confirm it will attempt to self-remediate on failure by running the
> exact commands `gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding` or `gcloud
> billing accounts add-iam-policy-binding` to grant the entire administrative
> group of roles to the active identity, and then retry the failed deployment
> command. 3. List the core administrative groups that it will attempt to grant
> (Organization Admin Group, Billing Admin Group, and Security Admin Group)
> mapped to their key roles. 4. Confirm it will halt execution and request
> manual administrator intervention if the self-remediation grant command fails.

#### Remediation Protocol

For any command that fails due to missing permissions:

1.  **Identify Required Admin Group**: Determine which administrative group is
    responsible for the failed action. Refer to the
    [Administrative IAM Reference](references/admin-iam.md#core-administrative-groups--roles)
    for details.
2.  **Attempt Self-Remediation**: Grant **all** roles belonging to that
    administrative group to the active authenticated account sequentially. Refer
    to the
    [Administrative IAM Reference Remediation Guide](references/admin-iam.md#remediation)
    for the copy-pasteable script commands:

    *   **For Organization/Folder level failures (Org Admin Group or Security
        Admin Group)**: Run `gcloud organizations add-iam-policy-binding`
        sequentially for each role in the group.
    *   **For Billing level failures (Billing Admin Group)**: Run `gcloud
        billing accounts add-iam-policy-binding` sequentially for each role in
        the group.

3.  **Halt on Remediation Failure**:

    *   If the grant commands succeed, immediately retry the failed deployment
        command.
    *   If any of the grant commands fail (e.g., due to lack of `setIamPolicy`
        admin rights), **halt execution** and instruct the user to ask their
        Organization/Billing Administrator to manually grant the entire
        administrative group of roles.

#### Phase-Specific Remediation Mapping

*   **Phase 3: Security Guardrails (Org Policies)**:
    *   If `gcloud org-policies set-policy` fails: Attempt to grant the entire
        **Organization Admin Group** (9 roles) at the organization level.
*   **Phase 4: Resource Hierarchy (Folders & Projects)**:
    *   If `gcloud resource-manager folders create` or `gcloud projects create`
        fails: Attempt to grant the entire **Organization Admin Group** (9
        roles) at the organization level.
*   **Phase 4: Billing Link**:
    *   If `gcloud billing projects link` fails: Attempt to grant the entire
        **Billing Admin Group** (3 roles) at the billing account level, and
        ensure the active identity is granted the **Organization Admin Group**
        (which contains `roles/billing.user`) at the organization level.
*   **Phase 5: Centralized Logging & Monitoring**:
    *   If `gcloud logging sinks create` fails at org level: Attempt to grant
        the entire **Logging/Monitoring Admin Group** (2 roles:
        `roles/logging.admin`, `roles/monitoring.admin`) and the **Security
        Admin Group** (9 roles) at the organization level.

### Phase 3: Security Guardrails (Org Policies)

Apply 17 baseline security controls at the organization root.

> [!CAUTION] Applying `iam.allowedPolicyMemberDomains` first can lock out the
> deployment identity if it resides in an unallowed domain. Ensure the
> deployment identity is safe before enforcing this policy.

1.  Generate the YAML configuration files for the 17 policies. Refer to the
    [Organization Policies Reference](references/org-policies.md) for the exact
    YAML templates for both Boolean and List constraints.
2.  Apply each organization policy sequentially using the `gcloud org-policies`
    tool:

    ```bash
    gcloud org-policies set-policy [POLICY_FILE_NAME].yaml
    ```

### Phase 4: Resource Hierarchy

#### 1. Folder Creation

Check if target folders exist to avoid duplication. The agent must check for all
4 folders: for any folder that already exists (e.g., if `Common` or `Production`
are already present), the agent must locate and reuse them; for any folder that
is missing (e.g., if `Non-Production` or `Development` are not present), the
agent must proceed to sequentially create them:

> [!IMPORTANT] When explaining how existing resources (folders and projects) are
> handled to prevent duplication, the agent **must** explicitly name the
> remaining missing folders (`Non-Production` and `Development`) and confirm
> that it will proceed to sequentially create only these missing folders and
> projects.

```bash
# Check and Create "Common" Folder
gcloud resource-manager folders list --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID] --filter="display_name=Common"
# If not present:
gcloud resource-manager folders create --display-name="Common" --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID]

# Check and Create "Production" Folder
gcloud resource-manager folders list --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID] --filter="display_name=Production"
# If not present:
gcloud resource-manager folders create --display-name="Production" --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID]

# Check and Create "Non-Production" Folder
gcloud resource-manager folders list --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID] --filter="display_name=Non-Production"
# If not present:
gcloud resource-manager folders create --display-name="Non-Production" --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID]

# Check and Create "Development" Folder
gcloud resource-manager folders list --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID] --filter="display_name=Development"
# If not present:
gcloud resource-manager folders create --display-name="Development" --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID]
```

#### 2. Project Creation and Billing Link

Check if target projects already exist in the folders by matching their display
names. If not present, generate a shared 8-character random suffix (e.g.,
`ab12cd34`) and create the projects sequentially, linking billing and enabling
APIs immediately:

```bash
# Check if "central-logging-monitoring" project exists in Common folder
gcloud projects list --filter="parent.id=[COMMON_FOLDER_ID] AND parent.type=folder AND name=central-logging-monitoring"

# If not present: Create, link billing, and enable APIs
gcloud projects create logging-[SUFFIX] --name="central-logging-monitoring" --folder=[COMMON_FOLDER_ID]
gcloud billing projects link logging-[SUFFIX] --billing-account=[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com logging.googleapis.com monitoring.googleapis.com --project=logging-[SUFFIX]

# Check if "production" project exists in Production folder
gcloud projects list --filter="parent.id=[PRODUCTION_FOLDER_ID] AND parent.type=folder AND name=production"

# If not present: Create, link billing, and enable APIs
gcloud projects create prod-[SUFFIX] --name="production" --folder=[PRODUCTION_FOLDER_ID]
gcloud billing projects link prod-[SUFFIX] --billing-account=[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com firestore.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com aiplatform.googleapis.com cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com apphub.googleapis.com designcenter.googleapis.com discoveryengine.googleapis.com iam.googleapis.com config.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com cloudasset.googleapis.com cloudkms.googleapis.com cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com --project=prod-[SUFFIX]

# Check if "non-production" project exists in Non-Production folder
gcloud projects list --filter="parent.id=[NON_PRODUCTION_FOLDER_ID] AND parent.type=folder AND name=non-production"

# If not present: Create, link billing, and enable APIs
gcloud projects create non-prod-[SUFFIX] --name="non-production" --folder=[NON_PRODUCTION_FOLDER_ID]
gcloud billing projects link non-prod-[SUFFIX] --billing-account=[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com firestore.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com aiplatform.googleapis.com cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com apphub.googleapis.com designcenter.googleapis.com discoveryengine.googleapis.com iam.googleapis.com config.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com cloudasset.googleapis.com cloudkms.googleapis.com cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com --project=non-prod-[SUFFIX]

# Check if "development" project exists in Development folder
gcloud projects list --filter="parent.id=[DEVELOPMENT_FOLDER_ID] AND parent.type=folder AND name=development"

# If not present: Create, link billing, and enable APIs
gcloud projects create dev-[SUFFIX] --name="development" --folder=[DEVELOPMENT_FOLDER_ID]
gcloud billing projects link dev-[SUFFIX] --billing-account=[BILLING_ACCOUNT_ID]
gcloud services enable compute.googleapis.com run.googleapis.com container.googleapis.com artifactregistry.googleapis.com firestore.googleapis.com pubsub.googleapis.com aiplatform.googleapis.com cloudaicompanion.googleapis.com apphub.googleapis.com designcenter.googleapis.com discoveryengine.googleapis.com iam.googleapis.com config.googleapis.com cloudbuild.googleapis.com cloudasset.googleapis.com cloudkms.googleapis.com cloudresourcemanager.googleapis.com --project=dev-[SUFFIX]
```

> [!NOTE] **Agentic Parallelism Option**: While the manual runbook enforces
> sequential project execution to avoid terminal race conditions, an AI agent
> with multi-agent orchestration capability may optionally spawn subagents to
> provision the 4 projects in parallel once folder IDs are resolved.

### Phase 5: Centralized Logging and Monitoring

Configure centralized audit logging and cross-project monitoring scope in the
`logging-[SUFFIX]` project.

Refer to the
[Centralized Logging and Monitoring Reference](references/logging-monitoring.md)
for the detailed step-by-step commands to:

1.  Create the central log bucket.
2.  Create the organization-wide log sink.
3.  Grant required IAM permissions to the log sink.
4.  Configure the cross-project monitoring metrics scope.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Validation Logic & Checklist

Evaluate the deployment against the following verification checks:

-   [ ] **Security Policies**: Run `gcloud org-policies list
    --organization=[ORGANIZATION_ID]` and verify all 17 target policies are
    enforced or correctly configured.
-   [ ] **Resource Folders**: Verify folders `Common`, `Production`,
    `Non-Production`, and `Development` exist under the organization root.
-   [ ] **Billing Linkage**: Run `gcloud billing projects list` and assert that
    all 4 newly created projects are linked to your billing account.
-   [ ] **Log Bucket & Retention**: Verify the log bucket `[ORG_NAME]-logging`
    exists in project `logging-[SUFFIX]`, is located in `global`, and has a
    retention period of exactly 30 days.
-   [ ] **Log Sink Routing**: Run `gcloud logging sinks describe` at the
    organization level and confirm the sink routes cloud audit logs to the
    global bucket and holds standard `writerIdentity` credentials.
-   [ ] **Metrics Scope Linkage**: Run `gcloud beta monitoring metrics-scopes
    describe` and assert that the `dev`, `non-prod`, and `prod` projects appear
    in the monitored list of the central `logging` project.
