# Getting Started with Google Analytics Admin API

The Google Analytics Admin API provides programmatic access to Google Analytics
account and property configuration. It lets you automate account management,
manage data streams, configure custom dimensions, and handle product
integrations.

## Enabling the API via Cloud CLI

Before making API calls, ensure the Google Analytics Admin API is enabled in
your Google Cloud project.

If `gcloud` is not found, prompt the user to install the Google Cloud CLI before
running these commands.

1.  **Enable the API:** Use the Cloud CLI (`gcloud`) to enable
    `analyticsadmin.googleapis.com`.

    ```bash
    gcloud services enable analyticsadmin.googleapis.com --quiet
    ```

    *Why: Enabling the API ensures your Cloud project has the necessary quota
    and permissions allocated for managing Google Analytics configurations.*

2.  **Verify API Enablement:**

    ```bash
    gcloud services list --enabled --filter="analyticsadmin.googleapis.com"
    ```

## Authentication

To authenticate your API requests, you must generate Application Default
Credentials (ADC) and give your account the necessary scopes. Run the following
command in your terminal:

```bash
gcloud auth application-default login --scopes="https://www.googleapis.com/auth/cloud-platform,https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.readonly"
```

*Why: This configures ADC in your local environment with the required Cloud
Platform and Google Analytics read-only scopes, allowing the client library to
automatically authenticate your requests.*

> [!NOTE] **Configuration Changes**: Methods changing the Google Analytics
> account/property configuration will need the
> `https://www.googleapis.com/auth/analytics.edit` scope.

## Admin API Use Cases

### Python Quick Start

1.  **Install the Client Library:**

    ```bash
    pip install google-analytics-admin
    ```

    If `pip` is not available, prompt the user to install `pip` before
    installing the client library.

2.  **List Accounts and Properties:** Below is a complete example demonstrating
    how to call the Admin API to list all available accounts and their child
    properties for the current user using `list_account_summaries()`.

    ```python
    from google.analytics.admin import AnalyticsAdminServiceClient

    def sample_list_account_summaries():
        # Initialize the client.
        # Assumes Application Default Credentials (ADC) are configured in your environment.
        client = AnalyticsAdminServiceClient()

        # list_account_summaries returns a summary of all accounts accessible to the
        # user and their child properties.
        account_summaries = client.list_account_summaries()

        print("Available Google Analytics Accounts and Properties:")
        for summary in account_summaries:
            print(f"Account: {summary.display_name} ({summary.account})")
            for property_summary in summary.property_summaries:
                print(f"  Property: {property_summary.display_name} ({property_summary.property})")

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        sample_list_account_summaries()
    ```
