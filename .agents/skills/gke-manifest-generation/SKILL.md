# GKE Manifest Generation Skill

This skill provides guidelines, tooling integration, and templates to translate
natural language descriptions or application code changes into secure,
compliant, and cost-effective Kubernetes YAML manifests optimized for both GKE
Autopilot and GKE Standard clusters.

## Core Rules & Verification

When generating or updating YAML manifests, you **must** strictly adhere to the
following rules:

### 1. Namespace & Resource Isolation

-   **Explicit Namespace**: Always declare `namespace: {namespace}` explicitly
    in the metadata of every resource (Deployments, Services, ConfigMaps,
    Secrets, PVCs, Roles, bindings). Map it to the namespace configured in your
    active `SETTINGS.md`. Never omit the namespace.
-   **Dedicated ServiceAccount**: Avoid using the namespace's `default`
    ServiceAccount. Always create and reference a dedicated `ServiceAccount`
    (e.g., `devteam-agent-sa`) for each microservice.

### 2. GKE Resource Tuning (Autopilot & Standard)

-   **Resources Requests & Limits**: Always specify CPU and Memory requests and
    limits for all containers.
    -   *GKE Autopilot*: Requests determine pod billing directly; requests and
        limits must be equal. If they differ, Autopilot will automatically scale
        requests up to match limits, which can significantly increase costs.
    -   *GKE Standard*: Requests ensure stable scheduling and bin-packing;
        limits prevent resource starvation/noisy-neighbor issues.
-   **Density Defaults**: For stateless apps or sidecars on GKE Standard,
    default to conservative requests (e.g., `requests.cpu: "100m"` or `"200m"`,
    `requests.memory: "256Mi"` or `"512Mi"`) with burstable limits. Use a
    reasonable overcommit ratio for limits (e.g., 2x to 4x requests, like
    `limits.cpu: "400m"` to `"800m"`, and `limits.memory: "512Mi"` to `"1Gi"`).
    Avoid excessive overcommit limits (like `limits.cpu: "4"` for a `100m`
    request) to prevent severe CPU throttling and latency degradation under
    heavy scheduling load, particularly in environments without guaranteed node
    shares.
-   **Spot VMs for Staging/Dev**: For non-production workloads (e.g., namespaces
    containing `-test`, `-dev`, or `-staging`), or if the user requests cost
    optimization, automatically target GKE Spot VMs. This requires injecting
    both the `nodeSelector` targeting Spot VMs AND the corresponding toleration
    to tolerate the Spot VM taint:

    ```yaml
    nodeSelector:
      cloud.google.com/gke-spot: "true"
    tolerations:
      - key: "cloud.google.com/gke-spot"
        operator: "Equal"
        value: "true"
        effect: "NoSchedule"
    ```

    (On GKE Standard, this assumes a Spot node pool is configured).

### 3. Container Security Hardening (Pod Security Standards)

-   **Non-Root Execution**: Always configure `securityContext` at the Pod level
    (and container level if overriding) to run as a non-root user (e.g.,
    `runAsNonRoot: true`, `runAsUser: 10000`, `runAsGroup: 10000`, `fsGroup:
    10000`). This is strictly enforced on GKE Autopilot and is a critical
    security baseline for GKE Standard.
-   **Minimal Privileges**: Always set `allowPrivilegeEscalation: false` and
    `seccompProfile: {type: RuntimeDefault}`.
-   **Read-Only Root Filesystem**: Set `readOnlyRootFilesystem: true` to prevent
    modifications to the container image filesystem.
    -   *Writable Directory Fallback*: If `readOnlyRootFilesystem` is enabled,
        mount a local `emptyDir` volume to `/tmp` or `/var/run/` to allow
        applications (like Java/Nginx) to write temp files without crashing.
-   **Secret Volume Mounting**: Prefer mounting Secrets as read-only files
    (configured in the `volumes` spec with `defaultMode: 0400`) instead of
    mapping them as environment variables, unless the application framework
    exclusively supports env-var based configuration. This prevents secrets
    leaking into application logs.

### 4. Health Checking (Mandatory Probes)

-   **Liveness & Readiness Probes**: Every Deployment container must define both
    `livenessProbe` and `readinessProbe`.
    -   **Web/API**: Use `httpGet` probes.
    -   **TCP Services**: Use `tcpSocket` probes.
    -   **Databases/Caches**: Use command-based `exec` probes (e.g.,
        `exec.command: ["redis-cli", "ping"]`).
-   **Startup Probes for Slow-Starting Apps**: For applications with slow boot
    times (e.g., Java spring boot, complex Python scripts, LLM model servers),
    you **must** also define a `startupProbe`. When a `startupProbe` is defined,
    the liveness and readiness probes are disabled until it succeeds, preventing
    Kubernetes from prematurely killing the pod during startup:

    ```yaml
    startupProbe:
      httpGet:
        path: /healthz
        port: 8080
      failureThreshold: 30
      periodSeconds: 10
    ```

-   **Sensible Defaults**: Set `initialDelaySeconds: 5` to `15` depending on
    startup time (e.g., Java requires a longer delay than Go/Nginx).

### 5. Services & Ingress Routing

-   **Internal ClusterIP**: Default all internal microservices to `type:
    ClusterIP`. Never use `type: LoadBalancer` or `NodePort` unless the workload
    is explicitly intended to be publicly accessible from the internet.
-   **Port Naming**: Always assign clear, standard names to service and
    container ports (e.g., `name: http-web` or `name: grpc-api`) to enable
    automatic protocol discovery, tracing, and Web App routing.
-   **Prefer Gateway API**: When exposing APIs externally, prioritize using GKE
    Gateway API (`Gateway` and `HTTPRoute` resources) over legacy `Ingress`
    objects to enable advanced L7 routing and security features (e.g., Cloud
    Armor).

### 6. Volume Mounts, StorageClasses & subPath Safety

-   **Avoid Directory Overwrites**: When mounting a `ConfigMap` or `Secret` to
    an application directory containing other files (like Nginx public
    directories), always use `subPath` to overlay only the specific file.
    *Caveat*: Note that containers using `subPath` volume mounts do not receive
    automatic configuration updates if the underlying ConfigMap or Secret is
    modified; pods must be restarted manually to pick up changes.
-   **StorageClass Selection**: Use the correct GKE storage class in
    PersistentVolumeClaims:
    -   *CSI Driver Clusters (Autopilot & Modern Standard)*: Use `standard-rwo`
        (default balanced PD) or `premium-rwo` (SSD PD).
    -   *Legacy Standard Clusters*: Use `standard` (default PD) or `premium`
        (SSD PD) if `standard-rwo`/`premium-rwo` are not configured.
    -   *Database rule*: Use SSD storage classes (`premium-rwo` or `premium`)
        only when the prompt explicitly requests high IOPS, low latency, or
        database storage.

### 7. High Availability on GKE

-   **Topology Spread**: For deployments with >1 replica, use `podAntiAffinity`
    or `topologySpreadConstraints` with `topologyKey: "kubernetes.io/hostname"`
    to distribute pods across GKE nodes and availability zones.
-   **PodDisruptionBudget**: For deployments with >1 replica, declare a
    `PodDisruptionBudget` to guarantee minimum replica availability during
    voluntary GKE node upgrades and maintenance cycles.

### 8. Updates & Server-Side Apply Reconciliations

-   **Stable List Keys**: Under Kubernetes Server-Side Apply (SSA), elements in
    associative lists (like volumes, volume mounts, ports, and container
    definitions) are matched and merged by their unique identifier keys
    (typically `name`). You **must** keep the `name` key stable when modifying
    properties of an existing list item. Renaming the `name` key will cause SSA
    to create a brand new entry and leave the old entry intact (orphaned) rather
    than modifying it.
-   **Minimal Diff**: Make only the changes requested. Adhere closely to
    existing labels, annotations, and conventions.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Specialty Workloads: GKE AI/Inference Serving (vLLM, TGI, etc.)

For model serving workloads, prioritize using optimized tooling like GKE
Inference Quickstart if available. If generating manually:

1.  **GPU Request & Allocation**:
    -   Always request `nvidia.com/gpu` in both `requests` and `limits`.
    -   Add a `nodeSelector` or node affinity targeting the desired GKE
        accelerator tag (e.g., `cloud.google.com/gke-accelerator: nvidia-l4`).
2.  **Shared Memory Boost**:
    -   Model servers require high shared memory (`/dev/shm`) for inter-process
        communications. Always declare and mount an `emptyDir` volume with
        `medium: Memory` to `/dev/shm`.
3.  **Weight Loading Optimization**:
    -   Mount model weight directories (like GCS buckets) using the GKE GCS Fuse
        CSI driver (`csi.storage.gke.io`) as `readOnly: true` for efficient
        cold-starts.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Tooling & Grounding Guidelines

When generating manifests, you should leverage the following tooling to reduce
hallucinations and optimize configurations:

1.  **Inference Workloads (GKE Inference Quickstart CLI)**:

    -   Make sure you have the
        [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) installed.
    -   For all AI/LLM inference workloads (e.g. model serving), you **must**
        prioritize using the `gcloud` CLI GKE Inference Quickstart command to
        generate the optimized manifests instead of writing them manually:

        ```bash
        gcloud container ai profiles manifests create \
          --model={model_name} \
          --model-server={server_name} \
          --accelerator-type={accelerator_type} \
          --output=manifest \
          --output-path={output_file_path}
        ```

    -   *Constraint*: You must include all resources returned by this command
        (Deployments, Services, PodMonitoring, etc.) without filtering.

2.  **Grounding in Official Documentation (Developer Knowledge API)**:

    -   For GKE-specific features, API defaults, manifest examples, or security
        contexts, you **must** query Google's developer knowledge base to
        retrieve official GKE documentation:
        -   **`answer_query`**: Use this to ask direct questions (e.g., *"How to
            configure GCS Fuse CSI driver in GKE"*). This is the preferred tool
            for general queries.
        -   **`search_documents`**: Use this to search for relevant GKE guides
            or examples when you don't have a specific question.
        -   **`get_document`**: Use this to fetch full document contents when
            you have a specific document ID.
