# GKE Workload Troubleshooting Skill

Use this skill to systematically diagnose and resolve failures in application
workloads deployed in GKE clusters. This skill operates non-interactively and
enforces a read-only diagnostics boundary: it only **proposes** fixes — whether
Kubernetes manifest/config patches or Google Cloud changes (for example `gcloud`
IAM bindings or node-pool recreation) — and never executes live mutations
itself.

## 🔍 Diagnostic Workflow

### Step 0: Non-Interactive Context Discovery & Time Window Definition

1.  **Parameter Extraction**: Extract required context (`project_id`,
    `cluster_name`, `cluster_location`, `workload_name`, `workload_namespace`)
    non-interactively from the user prompt, active `SETTINGS.md`, or active
    environment defaults:

    -   Default `workload_namespace` to `default` if omitted.
    -   Infer missing cluster parameters from active environment (`kubectl
        config current-context` or `gcloud config get-value project`).
    -   Prioritize non-interactive context discovery from prompts and
        environment defaults to ensure autonomous execution flow.

2.  **Cluster Credentials & Fallback Mode**:

    -   Attempt credential fetch: `gcloud container clusters get-credentials
        {cluster_name} --region/--zone {cluster_location}`
    -   **Fallback / Dry-Run Mode**: If the cluster is unreachable,
        non-existent, or live command execution fails (such as in sandboxed
        evaluations, dry-run mode, or offline analysis):
        -   Limit retry attempts to avoid resource exhaustion and context
            overflow in unreachable cluster scenarios.
        -   Immediately present the exact sequence of `kubectl` diagnostic
            commands for the human operator to run.
        -   Synthesize the root cause analysis and output the proposed GitOps
            manifest fix based on the reported symptoms.

3.  **Time Handling & Fallbacks**:

    -   **Determine Issue Timestamp ({issue_time})**:
        -   **Specific Time Provided**: If the user provides a specific
            timestamp, use it as `{issue_time}`.
        -   **Relative Time Provided (e.g., "5 minutes ago")**: Dynamically
            calculate the corresponding UTC timestamp based on current system
            time, and use it as `{issue_time}`.
        -   **No Time Provided (Default)**: Use current system time as
            `{issue_time}`.
    -   **Window Calculation**: Center a 1-hour query window around
        `{issue_time}` (`start_time` = `{issue_time} - 30m`, `end_time` =
        `{issue_time} + 30m`).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 1: Analyze Pod Status and Conditions

Inspect the workload's active pod states and controller status.

**Diagnostic Commands:**

```bash
# 1. Inspect the deployment's actual selector labels:
kubectl get deployment {workload_name} -n {workload_namespace} -o jsonpath='{.spec.selector.matchLabels}'
# 2. Query the pods using the returned labels, for example:
kubectl get pods -l {selector_labels} -n {workload_namespace}
kubectl get deploy/{workload_name} -n {workload_namespace} -o yaml
```

#### Diagnostic Decision Tree:

-   **Phase: Pending**:
    -   The Pod cannot schedule on any node. Proceed directly to **Step 2 (Query
        Namespace Events)**.
-   **State: CrashLoopBackOff / Error**:

    -   The container boots but exits repeatedly; the `kubelet` restarts it with
        an increasing back-off delay of up to five minutes. First read the
        terminated **reason** and **exit code**:

    ```bash
    kubectl describe pod {pod_name} -n {workload_namespace}
    kubectl get pod {pod_name} -n {workload_namespace} -o jsonpath='{.status.containerStatuses[*].lastState.terminated}'
    ```

    -   **Reason: OOMKilled (Exit Code 137)**: The container's memory limit was
        reached. Proceed to **Step 3 (Inspect Logs) → OOM Analysis** to classify
        container-level vs node-level, then **Step 5** to propose fixes.
    -   **Exit Code 0 (successful exit)**: Unexpected for a long-running
        Deployment/StatefulSet — `restartPolicy: Always` restarts the finished
        process, creating the loop. Common causes: the `command`/`entrypoint`
        does not start a persistent process, a worker exits on an empty queue,
        or a missing/invalid config (e.g., an unattached or mis-keyed
        `ConfigMap` volume) makes the app exit cleanly. Proceed to **Step 3
        (Inspect Logs)**.
    -   **Exit Code 128**: Invalid `command`/`entrypoint` — the executable path
        is wrong or absent in the image. Verify the container command in the
        manifest.
    -   **Exit Code 1 or other non-zero**: The application crashed —
        configuration errors, missing/invalid env vars or config files,
        unreachable dependencies, or auth failures (`401`/`403`) on Google Cloud
        calls (check the Pod's IAM / Workload Identity Federation). Proceed
        directly to **Step 3 (Inspect Logs)**.
    -   If the exit code looks healthy but the container keeps restarting,
        suspect a **liveness probe failure** (see Step 3).

-   **State: ImagePullBackOff / ErrImagePull**:

    -   The kubelet cannot pull the container image. `ImagePullBackOff` means it
        keeps retrying with back-off; `ErrImagePull` is a general,
        non-recoverable pull error. Related statuses: `InvalidImageName`,
        `RegistryUnavailable`, `SignatureValidationFailed`, `ImageInspectError`.
        Proceed to **Step 2 (Query Namespace Events)** to read the exact pull
        error message.

-   **State: ContainerCreating**:

    -   The container is blocked during volume mount, networking setup, or image
        pulling. Proceed directly to **Step 2 (Query Namespace Events)**.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 2: Query Namespace Events

Look for infrastructure, volume, image, or scheduling alerts in GKE.

**Diagnostic Command:**

```bash
kubectl get events -n {workload_namespace} --sort-by='.metadata.creationTimestamp'
# Or query Cloud Logging for historical GKE events within the time window:
gcloud logging read "resource.type=\"k8s_cluster\" AND logName=\"projects/{project_id}/logs/events\" AND jsonPayload.involvedObject.namespace=\"{workload_namespace}\"" --start-time="{start_time}" --end-time="{end_time}" --project="{project_id}"
# Or query specifically for image pull failures within the time window:
gcloud logging read 'log_id("events") AND resource.type="k8s_pod" AND resource.labels.cluster_name="{cluster_name}" AND jsonPayload.message=~"Failed to pull image"' --project="{project_id}"
```

*Note: Retrieve the sorted events list and manually inspect the event timestamps
(CreationTimestamp/LastSeen) to identify failures occurring within the
`{start_time}` and `{end_time}` window.*

#### Signature Identifiers:

-   **`FailedScheduling`**: Node resource exhaustion. Look for messages like
    `0/3 nodes are available: 3 Insufficient memory.` or missing node affinity
    tolerations (e.g. Spot VM taints).
-   **`FailedMount`**:
    -   Missing PersistentVolumeClaim (`PVC`).
    -   Missing Secret (`Secret "{secret_name}" not found`).
    -   Missing ConfigMap (`ConfigMap "{configmap_name}" not found`).
-   **`Failed` / `BackOff` (Image Pull)**: First read the exact event message
    (`Failed to pull image "IMAGE": ...`) and triage by what it actually says.
    Do **not** jump to IAM / node service-account investigation unless the
    message is genuinely a permission or authentication error.

    -   **Wrong image name/tag — start here** (`not found`, `manifest unknown`,
        `InvalidImageName`): the most common cause — the tag or path is wrong,
        or the image was deleted, frequently introduced by a recent deployment
        change.
        *   Identify the failing container image name and the invalid tag.
        *   Check the Git history for the last known working image tag: `git log
            -p -S "{image_name}" -- {manifest_file_path}` (or run `git log` on
            the folder containing manifests).
        *   Propose reverting the image tag to the last working version (or
            correcting the tag) in the manifest patch.
    -   **Permission / authentication errors only** (the message contains `403
        Forbidden` / `denied`, or `401 Unauthorized` / `unauthorized`): the node
        cannot authorize or authenticate to the registry. Pursue the checks
        below **only** when the message matches.

        *   **`403 Forbidden` (authorization)** — the node pool service account
            (or the imagePullSecret's service account) is missing registry read
            access. **Suggest** granting it by presenting the following command
            for the user to review and run; do not execute it. For **Artifact
            Registry**:

            ```bash
            gcloud artifacts repositories add-iam-policy-binding {repository} \
              --location={repo_location} \
              --member="serviceAccount:{node_service_account_email}" \
              --role="roles/artifactregistry.reader"
            ```

            For **Container Registry (`gcr.io`)**, grant
            `roles/storage.objectViewer` on the backing bucket (or the Artifact
            Registry role if `gcr.io` was migrated). Also check that any **VPC
            Service Controls** perimeter allows Artifact Registry.
        *   **`401 Unauthorized` (authentication)** — the node service account
            is disabled or the node lacks the required OAuth scope:

            ```bash
            gcloud container clusters describe {cluster_name} --location={cluster_location} \
              --format="table(nodePools.name,nodePools.config.serviceAccount)"
            gcloud iam service-accounts list \
              --filter="email:{node_service_account_email} AND disabled:true" --project={project_id}
            gcloud compute instances describe {node_name} --zone={node_zone} \
              --format="flattened(serviceAccounts[].scopes)"
            ```

            Scopes must include `devstorage.read_only` or `cloud-platform`
            (provided by `gke-default`). Nodes are immutable, so **suggest**
            recreating the node pool with `--scopes="gke-default"` if the scope
            is missing — present it as a proposed command for the user to run,
            do not execute it.
        *   **Private / self-hosted registry**: ensure a valid `imagePullSecret`
            exists and is referenced by the Deployment.
    -   **Other statuses**: `RegistryUnavailable` / `i/o timeout` / DNS `server
        misbehaving` → registry network path (DNS, firewall egress, Google API
        connectivity); `exec format error` or a deprecated schema-1 image →
        architecture/schema mismatch.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 3: Inspect Application Logs

Extract exceptions and stack traces from the application runtime.

**Diagnostic Commands:**

```bash
# Check current active log stream (handles multi-container pods)
kubectl logs {pod_name} -n {workload_namespace} --all-containers --tail=100

# Check logs from previously terminated container instances (handles multi-container pods)
kubectl logs {pod_name} -n {workload_namespace} --all-containers -p --tail=100
```

#### Signature Identifiers:

-   **Out-of-Memory (OOM) Analysis**: First confirm and classify the kill.

    -   **Container-level OOM** (most common): `kubectl describe pod` shows
        `Last State: Terminated`, `Reason: OOMKilled`, `Exit Code: 137`. The
        container exceeded its cgroup memory limit. Differentiate an
        **application memory leak/loop** (unbounded growth in logs and startup
        command) from an **infrastructure capacity mismatch** (legitimate demand
        exceeding `resources.limits.memory`).
    -   **Node-level (system) OOM**: the entire node ran out of memory; look for
        evicted Pods and node-pressure eviction. The combined memory of all Pods
        exceeded node capacity.
    -   **"Invisible" OOM** (`cgroup v1`): a child process is killed but the
        main process (PID 1) keeps running, so Kubernetes never marks
        `OOMKilled`. Search node logs in Cloud Logging:

        ```bash
        gcloud logging read 'resource.type="k8s_node" AND resource.labels.cluster_name="{cluster_name}" AND jsonPayload.MESSAGE:("TaskOOM event" OR "ContainerDied")' --project="{project_id}"
        ```

        A `TaskOOM` entry confirms an OOM kill; match its container ID to the
        `ContainerDied` entry to find the affected Pod. On the node, `journalctl
        -k` distinguishes container-level kills (`memory cgroup`, `memcg`) from
        system-level kills (`Out of memory: Killed process`).
    -   Do not rely solely on sampled memory metrics — they often miss the spike
        that triggers the kill. Then proceed to **Step 5** to propose fixes
        (raise limits, fix the leak, or right-size the node pool).
-   **Liveness Probe Failure (CrashLoop with no application error)**: if the
    container restarts but its logs show no crash, the `kubelet` may be killing
    it on failed liveness probes (default `failureThreshold: 3`). Confirm in
    Cloud Logging:

    ```bash
    gcloud logging read 'resource.type="k8s_node" AND log_id("kubelet") AND jsonPayload.MESSAGE:"failed liveness probe, will be restarted" AND resource.labels.cluster_name="{cluster_name}"' --project="{project_id}"
    ```

    Common fixes: correct the probe type/path/port, raise `initialDelaySeconds`
    or `timeoutSeconds`/`failureThreshold` for slow starts, or relieve CPU/disk
    I/O contention causing probe timeouts. Keep probe commands lightweight.
-   **Stack Trace / Unhandled Exception**: Look for language-specific stack
    traces (e.g., `panic:`, `NullPointerException`, `Traceback (most recent
    call)`). This indicates an application bug.
-   **Egress Network Timeout**: Look for connection timeouts (e.g., `Connection
    timed out`, `dial tcp: i/o timeout`). Proceed to **Step 4 (Verify
    Connectivity)**.
-   **Permission Errors (ReadOnlyRootFilesystem)**: Look for write errors (e.g.,
    `Read-only file system`, `Permission denied` when writing to `/tmp` or
    `/var/log`). Propose adding an `emptyDir` volume mount to that directory in
    the manifest.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 4: Verify Service Connectivity and Network Policies

Troubleshoot connection drops to other services.

**Diagnostic Commands:**

```bash
# Verify target endpoint is active
kubectl get endpoints {target_service_name} -n {target_namespace}

# Query network policies inside namespace
kubectl get networkpolicies -n {workload_namespace} -o yaml
```

#### Logic & Dry-Run Fallback:

1.  **Live Cluster Mode**:

    -   If `kubectl get endpoints` returns an empty list, the target
        microservice itself is failing to schedule or boot (troubleshoot target
        service).
    -   If endpoints exist but logs show timeouts, analyze `NetworkPolicy`
        egress blocks to verify if egress traffic to the target service's
        IP/port is allowed.

2.  **Sandboxed / Dry-Run Mode**:

    -   If live `kubectl` queries fail or cluster connection is unavailable, do
        NOT retry live cluster access or enter repetitive connection attempts.
    -   Immediately inspect the application source code (e.g. `worker.py`,
        `app.go`, DB connection strings) or Deployment manifests to identify the
        target service hostname (e.g. `account-db`) and destination port (e.g.
        `5432`).
    -   Present the exact `kubectl get endpoints` and `kubectl get
        networkpolicies` commands for the user, and synthesize the required
        `NetworkPolicy` egress patch allowing traffic to the target service and
        port.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Step 5: Propose GitOps Correction

Following the GitOps boundary, **do not apply changes directly** — this includes
both cluster manifest/config patches and any Google Cloud mutations (for example
`gcloud` IAM bindings or node-pool recreation). Present every change as a
reviewable suggestion: a manifest patch / PR, or a command for the user to run.

1.  Synthesize the root cause analysis for the human operator (e.g.
    *"payment-api is failing with exit code 137 because its memory limit is set
    to 256Mi while actual usage spiked to 270Mi"*).
2.  Generate the corrected YAML manifest patch (e.g. increase memory limits, add
    missing Secret mounts, or add tolerations for Spot nodes).
3.  Check if a branch or Pull Request (PR) already exists for this
    workload/failure. If so, update the existing branch/PR or notify the user
    instead of creating a duplicate. Otherwise, create a branch, commit the
    change, open a Pull Request (PR) on GitHub, and conclude the workflow (do
    not wait for human merge).
