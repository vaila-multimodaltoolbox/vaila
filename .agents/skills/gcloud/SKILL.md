This document provides essential guidelines and best practices for AI agents
interacting with the Google Cloud SDK (`gcloud` CLI). Following these rules is
critical to avoid hallucinated commands, flags, flag values, and positional
argument syntax, prevent destructive actions, and minimize context window usage.

## Execution Modes

AI agents can interact with Google Cloud resources in two primary ways:

-   **Direct CLI Execution**: Executing `gcloud` commands directly in a local or
    automated shell environment. See [CLI Usage](references/cli-usage.md) for
    installation, authentication flows, and configuration management.
-   **Model Context Protocol (MCP)**: Invoking structured tools via the Cloud
    CLI remote MCP server (`run_gcloud_command`). See
    [MCP Usage](references/mcp-usage.md) for tool schemas, parameter rules, and
    server configuration.

## Core Principles

### 1. Explicit Command Validation (Mandatory)

*   **Action**: **ALWAYS** call `gcloud help <command>` for the *exact* command
    that is intended to be run (e.g., `gcloud help compute instances create`).
*   **Verify**: Ensure the command, flags, flag values, and positional argument
    syntax are valid for that specific leaf command before attempting execution
    or presenting plans. Validation is not transitive from parent groups.

### 2. Data Reduction Strategies (Mandatory)

Minimize the volume of data returned by `gcloud` to save context window space
and reduce latency. DO NOT execute any `list` command without including at least
one data reduction flag (`--limit`, `--filter`, or `--format`).

*   **Projection**: Use `--format="json(key1, key2, ...)"` to select only the
    specific fields needed for the task. To understand the advanced projection
    and formatting syntax, refer to `gcloud topic projections` and `gcloud topic
    formats`.

*   **Limiting**: Use `--limit=N` to cap the number of resources returned.

*   **Filtering**: Use `--filter` to narrow down results server-side. Prioritize
    `:` for pattern matching and never quote the right side of the colon. Treat
    the entire filter flag as a singular string without quoting or escaping
    characters. To study the filter expression syntax, refer to `gcloud topic
    filters`.

*   **Schema Discovery**: Unconstrained resource lists can quickly exhaust the
    context window with redundant data. To prevent this, discover a resource's
    schema before executing queries. If unsure of the JSON key path for
    projecting fields (`--format`) or filtering (`--filter`), run the targeted
    resource's list command (if supported) with a single-item limit:

    ```bash
    gcloud <GROUP> <RESOURCE> list --limit=1 --format=json
    ```

    Examine this single instance's JSON structure to safely identify the correct
    schema keys before requesting full or filtered datasets.

### 3. Execution Constraints

*   **Single Commands**: Execute a single `gcloud` command at a time. No command
    chaining or sequencing.
*   **No Shell Operators**: Do not use command substitution (`$(...)`), pipes
    (`|`), or redirection (`>`, `>>`, `<`). This is to increase command safety
    and ensure commands are more easily understandable and reviewable by users.
*   **Non-Interactive Execution (`--quiet` / `-q`)**: Pass the `--quiet` (or
    `-q`) global flag on all execution commands (e.g., `gcloud pubsub topics
    delete temp-topic --quiet --project=test-project`). AI agents run in
    headless, non-interactive environments without a TTY or `stdin` input
    handler. Without `--quiet`, commands that prompt for user confirmation (such
    as deleting resources, approving defaults, or selecting unspecified regions)
    will pause execution indefinitely waiting for input, causing background task
    timeouts. Including `--quiet` forces non-interactive mode, causing `gcloud`
    to automatically accept safe default choices or fail immediately with an
    explicit error if required parameters are missing.
*   **No Blind Lists**: NEVER execute a `list` command without `--limit`,
    `--filter`, or `--format`.

### 4. Project and Location Scoping (Critical)

To ensure commands are deterministic, non-interactive, and target the correct
environment, they must explicitly provide project and location scoping.

*   **Explicit Project Target**: Do not rely on active configuration defaults.
    Always append `--project=<PROJECT_ID>` to all resource-manipulating and
    querying commands (unless running pure local config commands). This avoids
    accidental execution against the wrong project.

*   **Prevent Location Prompts**: Many Google Cloud resources are regional or
    zonal. If the location flag is omitted (e.g., `--region`, `--zone`, or
    `--location`), `gcloud` will trigger an interactive prompt to select a
    zone/region. This violates the **No Interactivity** rule. Always provide
    explicit location flags if the command requires them.

*   **Location Discovery**: If the correct region, zone, or location for a
    service is not known, run discovery commands first (remembering to limit
    results if there are many):

    *   **Compute Engine (VMs, Networks)**:

        *   `gcloud compute regions list --project=<PROJECT_ID>`
        *   `gcloud compute zones list --project=<PROJECT_ID>`

    *   **Other Services (Standard API Style)**: Many GCP services utilize a
        unified `locations list` command:

        *   `gcloud <GROUP> locations list --project=<PROJECT_ID>`
        *   *Examples*: `gcloud artifacts locations list`, `gcloud kms locations
            list`, `gcloud secrets locations list`.

## Safety & Guardrails

> [!CAUTION] **Destructive actions (delete, update, remove) MUST be explicitly
> authorized by the user.** Never invoke them autonomously unless explicitly
> instructed to do so in the context of a safe, pre-approved workflow.

### Prohibited Operations (Denylist)

NEVER execute the following commands autonomously. These require explicit
human-in-the-loop authorization:

*   **Any IAM policy, role, or binding modification** (Security): Risk of
    privilege escalation, administrative lockout, service disruption, or
    unauthorized data exposure.
*   **No Proactive API Enabling**: Assume necessary APIs are enabled. To prevent
    unexpected resource provisioning or billing charges, do not proactively try
    to enable APIs. User approval is required to enable any API.
*   **`gcloud * delete`** (Destructive): Irreversible resource destruction
    (e.g., project deletion) or data wiping.
*   **`gcloud billing *`** (Financial): Risk of service disruption or unbounded
    costs.
*   **`gcloud organizations *`** (Governance): Org-level changes affect security
    posture for all users.
*   **`gcloud kms *`** (Encryption): Risk of permanently locking data.
*   **`gcloud infra-manager deployments apply`** (Destructive): Autonomous IaC
    execution can destroy managed resources.

### Execution Guidelines

*   **Dry Run (Mandatory)**: If the `--dry-run` or `--validate-only` flag (or
    equivalent) is listed in the command help output, ALWAYS include the flag in
    the proposed command or initial execution step. ALWAYS preview changes with
    `--dry-run` or `--validate-only` prior to actual execution.

*   **Long Running Operations**: For commands that support it, the `--async`
    flag is highly recommended for long-running operations to avoid blocking the
    agentic flow. Note that not every command has an `--async` flag. For
    commands that return an operation ID (whether via `--async` or by default),
    operation status must be polled for completion, if needed for the next step.

*   **Non-Interactive Flag (`--quiet`)**: Include `--quiet` (or `-q`) on all
    proposed or executed commands to guarantee non-interactive execution without
    waiting for TTY confirmation prompts.

## Structured Workflows

### Discovery Workflow

When asked to perform a task on a service that is unfamiliar:

1.  **Invoke Help**: Call `gcloud help <COMMAND>` on the target leaf command
    prior to execution.
2.  **Traverse Command Tree**: Run help on command groups (e.g., `gcloud help
    compute` or `gcloud help`) to discover available subgroups and commands if
    the exact command is unknown.
3.  **Discover Schema**: Run `gcloud <GROUP> <RESOURCE> list --limit=1
    --format=json` to inspect JSON keys before constructing filters or
    projections. DO NOT execute unconstrained `list` commands without scoping
    flags (e.g., `--limit=1`) to prevent context window exhaustion.
4.  **Enforce Data Reduction**: Include data reduction flags (`--limit`,
    `--filter`, `--format`) on all command executions.
