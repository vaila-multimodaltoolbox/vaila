# IMA SDK client-side

The Google IMA SDK (Interactive Media Ads) lets you load in-stream video and
audio ads into websites, apps, TVs and other digital platforms. Use an IMA SDK
to request ads from any VAST-compliant ad server and manage ad playback.

## Prerequisites

Before integrating the IMA SDK, you **must** read the platform-specific guide
below to support all platforms that your app can support:

*   **Web/HTML5/ReactJs/NodeJs/Angular:** Read all these guides
    [ima-sdk-web-guide.md](references/ima-sdk-web-guide.md),
    [ima-sdk-web-iframe-mode.md](references/ima-sdk-web-iframe-mode.md),
    [ima-sdk-web-mobile-safari.md](references/ima-sdk-web-mobile-safari.md)
*   **Android/AndroidTV/ReactNative:** Read [ima-sdk-android-guide.md](references/ima-sdk-android-guide.md)
*   **iOS/tvOS/ReactNative:** Read all these guides
    [ima-sdk-ios-guide.md](references/ima-sdk-ios-guide.md),
    [ima-sdk-tvos-guide.md](references/ima-sdk-tvos-guide.md)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start (general workflow)

1.  Import the SDK: Prerequisites, dependencies.
2.  Initialization: Early setup, Warmup, Settings Configuration, and Ad UI
    Setup.
3.  Ad Request: Creating and triggering the request, User gesture compliance.
4.  Ad Load Success/Failure: Handling the load event to get the AdsManager, or
    handling early fatal errors.
5.  Ad Playback Events: Listening to playback events via AdsManager to
    coordinate content play/pause, and handling non-fatal LOG events and fatal
    active playback errors.
6.  Cleanup: Properly destroying the AdsManager to release resources and prevent
    memory leaks.

For detailed, platform-specific implementation details, always refer to the
guides in the Prerequisites section.
