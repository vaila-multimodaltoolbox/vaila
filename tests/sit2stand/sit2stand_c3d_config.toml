#
# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
# 1. Edit the values below to customize your sit-to-stand analysis for C3D files.
# 2. Save this file.
# 3. Run batch analysis from command line:
#    python sit2stand.py config.toml /path/to/c3d/files [output_directory]
# 4. Example: python sit2stand.py sit2stand_c3d_config.toml /data/c3d /data/output
#
# IMPORTANT: Keep the format exactly as shown!
# - true/false must be lowercase
# - Numbers can have decimals (3.0) or not (30)
# - Text must be in quotes ("FZ1")
#
# Each section below controls a part of the analysis.
# All options are explained with examples.
# ================================================================

[analysis]
# Column containing vertical force data for sit-to-stand analysis
# For C3D files, use the analog channel name (e.g., "FZ1", "FZ2", "Analog.FZ1")
# Common C3D force channel patterns: FZ1, FZ2, FZ3, FZ4, Force.Fz1, etc.
force_column = "Force.Fz1"

[filtering]
# Butterworth low-pass filter for noise reduction
enabled = true
# Cutoff frequency in Hz - typical values: 4.0-15.0 for human movement
cutoff_frequency = 10.0
# Sampling frequency in Hz - must match your C3D analog sampling rate
# Common values: 1000, 2000, 10000 Hz depending on your system
# Based on the C3D file analysis, using 1000 Hz
sampling_frequency = 1000.0
# Filter order - higher values = sharper cutoff but more phase distortion
order = 4

[detection]
# Sit-to-stand movement detection parameters
# Force threshold above baseline for movement onset (in Newtons)
force_threshold = 15.0
# Minimum duration of movement phase (in seconds)
min_duration = 0.3
# Threshold for movement onset detection (above baseline)
onset_threshold = 8.0

# ================================================================
# C3D FILE INFORMATION (for reference):
# ================================================================
#
# The C3D file should contain analog channels for force data.
# Common channel naming patterns in C3D files:
# - FZ1, FZ2, FZ3, FZ4 (force plates 1-4)
# - FX1, FY1, FZ1 (force plate 1, X/Y/Z components)
# - Force.Fz1, Moment.Mx1 (structured naming)
# - Analog.FZ1, Analog.FX1 (analog board naming)
#
# The module will automatically detect available channels and
# suggest the most appropriate one if not specified in config.
# ================================================================
#
# EXAMPLE CONFIGURATIONS FOR DIFFERENT C3D SYSTEMS:
# ================================================================
#
# For AMTI force plates (common in biomechanics labs):
# force_column = "FZ1"
# sampling_frequency = 1000.0
# cutoff_frequency = 10.0
#
# For Kistler force plates:
# force_column = "FZ1"
# sampling_frequency = 2000.0
# cutoff_frequency = 15.0
#
# For Bertec force plates:
# force_column = "FZ1"
# sampling_frequency = 1000.0
# cutoff_frequency = 8.0

# For systems using structured naming:
# force_column = "Force.Fz1"
# sampling_frequency = 1000.0
# cutoff_frequency = 10.0
#
# For research with very high-frequency data:
# sampling_frequency = 10000.0
# cutoff_frequency = 20.0
# force_threshold = 25.0
#
# For elderly subjects (more sensitive detection):
# force_threshold = 10.0
# onset_threshold = 5.0
# min_duration = 0.5
