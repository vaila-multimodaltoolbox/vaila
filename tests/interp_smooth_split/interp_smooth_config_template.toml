# HOW TO USE THIS FILE:
# 1. Edit the values below to customize your interpolation and smoothing.
# 2. Save this file.
# 3. In the script, click 'Load TOML configuration'.
# 4. Select this file and run your analysis.
#
# IMPORTANT: Keep the format exactly as shown!
# - true/false must be lowercase
# - Numbers can have decimals (3.0) or not (30)
# - Text must be in quotes ("linear")
#
# Each section below controls a part of the processing.
# All options are explained with examples.
# ================================================================

[interpolation]
# Method for filling gaps in your data.
# Options: "linear", "cubic", "nearest", "kalman", "none", "skip"
#   - linear: straight lines between points (most common)
#   - cubic: smooth curves
#   - nearest: copy nearest valid value
#   - kalman: predictive filling (advanced)
#   - none: leave gaps as NaN
#   - skip: do not fill gaps, only apply smoothing
method = "linear"
# Maximum gap size to fill (in frames).
# 0 = fill all gaps, 60 = fill up to 2 seconds at 30fps.
max_gap = 60

[smoothing]
# Method for smoothing the data after filling gaps.
# Options: "none", "savgol", "lowess", "kalman", "butterworth", "splines", "arima"
#   - none: no smoothing
#   - savgol: Savitzky-Golay filter (preserves peaks)
#   - lowess: Local regression (for noisy data)
#   - kalman: Kalman filter (for tracking)
#   - butterworth: Butterworth filter (biomechanics standard)
#   - splines: Spline smoothing (very smooth curves)
#   - arima: ARIMA model (time series)
method = "none"
#
# --- Parameters for each smoothing method (only the relevant ones are used) ---
# Savitzky-Golay (savgol):
window_length = 7    # Odd number, e.g. 5, 7, 9
polyorder = 3        # Usually 2 or 3
# LOWESS:
frac = 0.3           # Fraction of data (0.1-1.0)
it = 3               # Number of iterations
# Kalman:
n_iter = 5           # EM algorithm iterations (3-10)
mode = 1             # 1 = simple, 2 = advanced
# Butterworth:
cutoff = 10.0        # Cutoff frequency in Hz (e.g. 4.0, 10.0)
fs = 100.0           # Sampling frequency (video FPS, e.g. 30.0, 100.0)
# Splines:
smoothing_factor = 1.0   # 0 = no smoothing, 1 = moderate, 10+ = strong
# ARIMA:
p = 1                # AR order
d = 0                # Difference order
q = 0                # MA order

[padding]
# Add extra frames at the start and end to avoid edge effects.
# percent = how much padding to add (as percent of data length).
# 0 = no padding, 10 = 10%% of data length (recommended).
percent = 10.0

[split]
# Split the data into two parts?
# enabled = true/false
enabled = false
