MultiModal-Mocap-Coord-Toolbox Help:

This toolbox provides various functionalities for analyzing multimodal motion capture (MoCap) data. Below is a brief explanation of each feature available in this toolbox along with instructions on what to do for each command.
Available Multimodal Analysis ['data' folder]:

    IMU Analysis
        Description: Analyze Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) data stored in CSV format. It processes and interprets motion data from wearable IMU sensors.
        Instructions: Place your IMU CSV files in the data/imu_csv directory. The analysis will process these files to extract and visualize the motion data.

    Kinematic Cluster Analysis
        Description: Analyze cluster marker data stored in CSV format. It helps in interpreting the motion data collected from marker-based motion capture systems.
        Instructions: Place your cluster CSV files in the data/cluster_csv directory. You will be prompted to enter the sample rate and the configuration for the trunk and pelvis. Optionally, provide anatomical position data in data/cluster_csv/anatomical_position.

    Kinematic Mocap Full Body Analysis
        Description: Analyze full-body motion capture data in C3D format. It processes the data captured by motion capture systems that track full-body movements.
        Instructions: Place your C3D files in the data/mocap_fullbody_c3d directory. The analysis will convert these files and process the motion capture data.

    Markerless 2D with video
        Description: Analyze 2D video data without using markers. It processes the motion data from 2D video recordings to extract relevant motion parameters.
        Instructions: Place your 2D video files in the data/markerless_2D_video directory. The analysis will process these videos to extract motion data.

    Markerless 3D with multiple videos
        Description: Process 3D video data without markers. It analyzes 3D video recordings to extract motion data and parameters.
        Instructions: Place your 3D video files in the data/markerless_3D_videos directory. The analysis will process these videos to extract 3D motion data.

Available Tools:

    Reorder CSV data columns
        Description: Organize and rearrange data files within a specified directory. Ensures that the data is structured in a consistent and usable format.
        Instructions: Place the CSV files you want to reorder in the data/rearrange_data directory. The tool will process these files to reorder the columns.

    Convert C3D data to CSV
        Description: Convert motion capture data files from C3D format to CSV format. This makes it easier to analyze and manipulate the data using standard data analysis tools.
        Instructions: Place your C3D files in the data/c3d_2_convert_in_csv directory. The tool will convert these files to CSV format.

    Modify Laboratory Reference System
        Description: Modify the laboratory coordinate system in CSV files. Applies specific transformations to the coordinate data, ensuring alignment with the desired coordinate system.
        Instructions: Place your CSV files in the data/csv_2_modify_labcoordsystem directory. You will be prompted to choose the modification option for the laboratory coordinate system.

    Count frames in videos
        Description: Count the number of frames in video files. This is useful for synchronizing video data with other motion capture data.
        Instructions: Place your video files in the data/video_frame_count directory. The tool will count and display the number of frames for each video file.

    Cut videos based on list
        Description: Cut video files based on a list of specified time intervals. This is useful for segmenting videos into relevant portions for analysis.
        Instructions: Place your video files and the list of time intervals in the data/video_cut directory. The tool will process these files to cut the videos accordingly.

    Draw a black box around videos
        Description: Overlay a black box around video frames to highlight specific areas of interest. This can help in focusing on particular regions during analysis.
        Instructions: Place your video files in the data/video_black_box directory. The tool will overlay a black box around the specified area in the videos.

    Compress videos to HEVC (H.265)
        Description: Compress video files using the HEVC (H.265) codec. This helps in reducing the file size while maintaining video quality.
        Instructions: Place your video files in the data/video_compress_h265 directory. The tool will compress these videos using the HEVC codec.

    Compress videos to H.264
        Description: Compress video files using the H.264 codec. This helps in reducing the file size while maintaining video quality.
        Instructions: Place your video files in the data/video_compress_h264 directory. The tool will compress these videos using the H.264 codec.
