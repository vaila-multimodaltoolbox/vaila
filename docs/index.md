- **FFmpeg**: Required for video processing functionalities.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vaila-multimodaltoolbox/vaila
cd vaila
```

## Installation Instructions

---

## üü† For Linux:

1. **Make the installation script executable**:

```bash
sudo chmod +x install_vaila_linux.sh
```

2. **Run instalation script**:

```bash
./install_vaila_linux.sh

- Ensure that Conda is added to your PATH and accessible from the command line.

---

## ‚ö™ For macOS:

1. **Make the installation script executable**:

```bash
sudo chmod +x install_vaila_mac.sh
```

2. **Run the installation script**:

```bash
./install_vaila_mac.sh
```

- The script will:
  - Set up the Conda environment using `./yaml_for_conda_env/vaila_mac.yaml`.
  - Copy program files to your home directory (`~/vaila`).
  - Install ffmpeg using Homebrew.
  - Convert the .iconset folder to an .icns file for the app icon.

---

## üîµ For Windows:

1. **Download and Install Anaconda**:

- Make sure to download and install [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/success).
- Ensure that **Conda** is installed and accessible from the command line.

2. **Download vail√°**:
  You can either:

- **Clone the repository** using git:

  ```bash
  git clone https://github.com/vaila-multimodaltoolbox/vaila
  cd vaila
  ```
  
- **Or download the vail√° zip file directly from your browser:**
  - **Go to** `https://github.com/vaila-multimodaltoolbox/vaila/archive/refs/heads/main.zip`
  - **Unzip the downloaded file (for example, into your Downloads folder).**

3. **Run the Installation Script as Administrator:**
  
  Now you need to install vail√° `Anaconda Powershell Prompt` as an administrator:

- Press the Windows key and search for "Anaconda PowerShell Prompt".
- Right-click on Anaconda PowerShell Prompt and select "Run as administrator".
- Navigate to the directory where you git clone or downloaded unzipped the vail√° files (e.g., C:\Users\YourUserName\Downloads\vaila).
- Run the installation script:

  ```Anaconda Powershell Prompt
  ./install_vaila_win.ps1
  ```

4. **Allow Script Execution (if necessary):**

If the script execution is blocked, you may need to change the execution policy. Run this command in PowerShell as Administrator:

  ```Anaconda Powershell Prompt
  Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned
  ```

5. **The Instructions Displayed by the Script:**

The script will:

- Set up the Conda environment using `vaila_win.yaml` inside directory/folder `yaml_for_conda_env`.  
- Install FFmpeg using winget or Chocolatey if necessary.
- Copy program files to C:\ProgramData\vaila.
- Configure the vaila profile in Windows Terminal (recommend you have Windows Terminal installed on your computer).
- Create a Desktop a Start Menu shortcut.

6. **If the Windows Terminal profile was not automatically added, follow the instructions below to manually add it. (if necessary)**

### Manual Addition to Windows Terminal (if necessary)

 ```json
{
    "name": "vaila",
    "commandline": "pwsh.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -NoExit -Command '& \"%ProgramData%\\Anaconda3\\shell\\condabin\\conda-hook.ps1\" ; conda activate \"vaila\" ; cd \"C:\\ProgramData\\vaila\" ; python \"vaila.py\"'",
    "startingDirectory": "C:\\ProgramData\\vaila",
    "icon": "C:\\ProgramData\\vaila\\docs\\images\\vaila_ico.png",
    "colorScheme": "Vintage",
    "guid": "{17ce5bfe-17ed-5f3a-ab15-5cd5baafed5b}",
    "hidden": false
}
```

Now the installation instructions are simplified, ensuring users download vail√°, run the script with administrator privileges, and see the vail√° icon in all the intended places (Desktop, Start Menu, and Windows Terminal).

When vail√° is installed on Windows, the files are copied to the following directory:

  ```PowerShell
  C:\ProgramData\vaila
  ```

This location is used to store data and configuration files that are accessible to all users on the system. However, the `ProgramData` directory is usually hidden in Windows. To access it, follow these steps:

- Open File Explorer.
- Go to the View tab in the top menu.
- Check the Hidden items box to display the `C:\ProgramData` directory.
- Navigate to `C:\ProgramData\vaila`.

For more information about the ProgramData folder on Windows, you can refer to the official [Microsoft documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/customize/desktop/unattend/microsoft-windows-shell-setup-folderlocations-programdata)

## Running the Application

### Running the Application After installation, you can launch *vail√°* from your applications menu or directly from the terminal, depending on your operating system.

- üü† Linux and ‚ö™ macOS: **From the Terminal bash or zsh**

1. Navigate to the `vaila` directory:
   
  ```bash
  cd ~/vaila
  ``` 

and run command:

  ```bash
  conda activate vaila
  python3 vaila.py
  ```

- üîµ Windows

- Click on the `vaila` icon in the Applications menu or use the shortcut in desktop or Windows Terminal.

- Windows: **From the Windows Terminal (Anaconda in path) or use Anaconda PowerShell**

1. Open Anaconda Prompt or Anaconda Powershell Prompt (Anaconda Powershell is recommended) and run command:

```Anaconda Powershell
conda activate vaila
python vaila.py
```

---

## If preferred, you can also run *vail√°* from the launch scripts.

### For üü† Linux and ‚ö™ macOS 

- From the Applications Menu:
  
  - Look for `vaila` in your applications menu and launch it by clicking on the icon. 

--- 

#### From the Terminal If you prefer to run *vail√°* from the terminal or if you encounter issues with the applications menu, you can use the provided launch scripts.

##### üü†Linux and ‚ö™ macOS

- **Make the script executable** (if you haven't already):

- üü† **Linux**
  
```bash
sudo chmod +x ~/vaila/linux_launch_vaila.sh
```

- **Run the script**:
  
```bash
~/vaila/linux_launch_vaila.sh 
```

- ‚ö™ **macOS**
  
```bash
sudo chmod +x ~/vaila/mac_launch_vaila.sh
```

- **Run the script**:
  
```bash
~/vaila/mac_launch_vaila.sh 
```

#### Notes for üü† Linux and ‚ö™ macOS 

- **Ensure Conda is in the Correct Location**:
  - The launch scripts assume that Conda is installed in `~/anaconda3`. 
  - If Conda is installed elsewhere, update the `source` command in the scripts to point to the correct location.

- **Verify Paths**:
  - Make sure that the path to `vaila.py` in the launch scripts matches where you have installed the program.
  - By default, the scripts assume that `vaila.py` is located in `~/vaila`.

- **Permissions**:
  - Ensure you have execute permissions for the launch scripts and read permissions for the program files.
