Description:
------------
This script serves as the central control interface for the VAILA (Virtual Analysis 
for Interactive Learning in Biomechanics) toolbox, providing a user-friendly graphical 
user interface (GUI) for selecting and executing various biomechanical analysis scripts. 
The analyses offered in this toolbox support the study and evaluation of postural control, 
dynamic balance, gait data, and force measurements, which are critical in both clinical 
and research settings.

Key Analyses Supported:
-----------------------
1. Force Cube Analysis: Examines force data captured in a cubic arrangement, allowing for 
   multidirectional force vector analysis.
2. Center of Pressure (CoP) Balance Analysis: Evaluates postural stability by analyzing 
   the center of pressure data, providing insights into balance control and sway 
   characteristics.
3. Force CMJ (Countermovement Jump) Analysis: Analyzes the forces involved in a 
   countermovement jump to assess athletic performance, muscle power, and explosiveness.
4. Noise Signal Fixing: Identifies and corrects noise artifacts in force signals, ensuring 
   data accuracy for subsequent analyses.
5. Calculate CoP: Executes a process to calculate the CoP data.
6. Gait Analysis (Single Strike): Analyzes a single contact strike in gait data, calculating 
   key metrics such as peak force, impulse, and rate of force development.

Functionalities:
----------------
1. GUI for Analysis Selection: Utilizes Python's Tkinter library to present a straightforward 
   interface where users can choose their desired analysis with ease.
2. Dynamic Module Importing: Efficiently loads only the necessary module for the selected 
   analysis, conserving system resources and improving performance.
3. Execution of Analysis: Automatically runs the main function of the selected analysis module, 
   guiding users through any necessary data input or parameter settings.

Modules and Packages Required:
------------------------------
- Python Standard Libraries: tkinter for GUI creation and management.
- External Libraries: None required; all functionalities are built using standard Python libraries.
- VAILA Toolbox Modules: 
  * force_cube_fig: For analyzing force cube data.
  * cop_analysis: For conducting CoP balance analysis.
  * force_cmj: For analyzing countermovement jump dynamics.
  * fixnoise: For correcting noise in force data.
  * cop_calculate: For calculating CoP data.
  * gait_analysis: For analyzing single strike gait data.

How to Use:
-----------
1. Run the Script: 
   Execute the script from the terminal using:
   python -m vaila.forceplate_analysis
   Alternatively, double-click the script file if your environment supports it.

2. Select Analysis:
   A GUI window will appear, prompting you to select the type of analysis to perform. Click on 
   the corresponding button for the desired analysis.

3. Follow Instructions:
   The selected analysis will start, and you will be guided through the necessary steps, such as 
   choosing data files or entering parameters. Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the 
   analysis.
