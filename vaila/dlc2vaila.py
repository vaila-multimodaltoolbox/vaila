Script: dlc2vaila.py
Author: Prof. Dr. Paulo Santiago
Version: 1.0.0
Last Updated: December 9, 2024

Description:
    This script converts DLC (DeepLabCut) CSV files into a format compatible with
    the vail치 multimodal toolbox. It processes all CSV files from a specified input
    directory, adjusts their structure, and saves the converted files in a newly
    created directory with a timestamped name.

    The conversion process includes:
    - Retaining only the third header line from the original DLC file.
    - Removing the first column temporarily, processing the remaining data, and re-adding the first column.
    - Excluding every third column from the data.
    - Generating a new header with the format: 'frame, p1_x, p1_y, p2_x, p2_y, ...'.
    - Saving the processed files in a dedicated output directory with a timestamp.

Usage:
    - Run the script to select an input directory containing DLC CSV files.
    - The script will process each file and save the converted outputs in a new
      directory created within the input directory.

How to Execute:
    1. Ensure Python and required dependencies are installed:
       - Install NumPy: `pip install numpy`
       - Install pandas: `pip install pandas`
       - Tkinter is usually bundled with Python installations.
    2. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where `dlc2vaila.py` is located.
    3. Run the script using Python:

       python dlc2vaila.py

    4. Follow the graphical interface prompts to select the input directory.
    5. The script will process the files and save them in a new directory.

New Features:
    - Batch processing of all DLC CSV files in the selected directory.
    - Creation of a dedicated output directory with a timestamped name.
    - Reduction of data noise by excluding irrelevant columns.
    - Generation of vail치-compatible headers.

Requirements:
    - Python 3.11.9 or later
    - NumPy (`pip install numpy`)
    - pandas (`pip install pandas`)
    - Tkinter (usually included with Python installations)

Output:
    For each processed DLC CSV file, the following output is generated:
    - A converted CSV file with the same name as the original, appended with a timestamp.
    - All converted files are saved in a new directory named `dlc_to_vaila_<timestamp>` within the input directory.

Example:
    1. Select a folder containing DLC CSV files.
    2. The script processes each file and saves the converted outputs in a new folder named
       `dlc_to_vaila_<timestamp>` within the input directory.
    3. Each converted file will have a filename in the format `<original_name>_<timestamp>.csv`.
