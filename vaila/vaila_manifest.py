"""
Script: vaila_manifest.py
Description: Displays the vailá manifest and logo in a Tkinter window as part of the vailá -
             Multimodal Toolbox. The script opens a new window that shows a message with
             the vailá philosophy and includes the vailá logo if available.

             This script dynamically finds the logo image and adjusts paths to ensure
             compatibility when running both from the terminal and the macOS Launchpad.

Version: 2024-09-22
Author: Prof. Dr. Paulo R. P. Santiago

Usage:
    - Run directly as part of the vailá framework.
    - The script loads and displays the vailá manifest and logo.
    - Make sure that the image `vaila_logo.png` is in the `images` directory relative to the
      script or specify the absolute path.

Notes:
    - Ensure that the PIL (Pillow) library is installed (`pip install Pillow`).
    - The script automatically adjusts the image path based on the script's location, making
      it compatible with both terminal and graphical launch methods (e.g., Launchpad).

Requirements:
    - Python 3.x
    - Tkinter for GUI
    - Pillow for image handling
