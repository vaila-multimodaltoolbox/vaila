## vailá — Vertical Jump Analysis (vaila_and_jump.py)

This guide explains how to use the Vertical Jump Analysis tool in vailá. It covers inputs, workflow, outputs, and core equations. The instructions below are in English to standardize project documentation.

### Overview
- Three modes:
  - Time-of-Flight: estimate jump height from flight time
  - Jump-Height: use measured jump height directly
  - MediaPipe Pose: read 2D pose CSVs, convert to meters, compute Center of Gravity (CG), and derive metrics
- Outputs include plots, calibrated CSVs, and an HTML report

### Accepted MediaPipe Inputs (CSV)
- File naming (vailá style): landmark columns like `nose_x`, `nose_y`, `right_ankle_x`, `right_ankle_y`, etc.
- You may use either of the CSVs exported by Markerless 2D Analysis:
  1) Normalized CSV: `*_mp_norm.csv` (x,y in [0..1]) — recommended
  2) Pixel CSV: `*_mp_pixel.csv` (x,y in pixels)
- The script converts coordinates to meters using a shank-length scale factor, so both forms are supported. For the most predictable behavior, prefer the normalized CSV.

### Coordinate System
- Biomechanical convention: y increases upward
- For MediaPipe inputs, the script reorients y to match this convention and then converts all coordinates to meters
- CG is normalized relative to the average CG over the initial frames (default: frames 10–20)

### Quick Start
1) Run the tool
   - From vailá GUI or: `python vaila/vaila_and_jump.py`
2) Choose the directory with your CSV files
3) Select the data type: (1) Time of Flight, (2) Jump Height, or (3) MediaPipe
4) MediaPipe mode requires subject constants (asked once per batch):
   - Mass (kg), Video FPS, Shank length (m)
   - To avoid prompts, create `vaila_and_jump_config.toml` in `vaila/` or `vaila/models/`:
     ```toml
     [jump_context]
     mass_kg = 75.0
     fps = 240
     shank_length_m = 0.40
     ```
5) Review outputs in the generated timestamped folder

### Outputs
- CSV: `<name>_jump_metrics_<timestamp>.csv` — summary metrics
- CSV: `<name>_calibrated_<timestamp>.csv` — calibrated (meters) and normalized series
- CSV: `<name>_jump_database_<timestamp>.csv` — one-row database with all metrics
- PNG: diagnostic and phase plots (CG and feet) and stick-figure visualizations
- HTML: `<name>_report_<timestamp>.html` — comprehensive report

### Equations
- Height from time of flight: \( h = \frac{g\, t^2}{8} \)
- Takeoff velocity: \( v = \sqrt{2 g h} \)
- Potential energy: \( E_p = m g h \)
- Kinetic energy: \( E_k = \tfrac{1}{2} m v^2 \)
- Average propulsion power: \( \bar{P} = (E_k + E_p) / t_{prop} \)
- Vertical force: \( F(t) = m [a(t) + g] \)
- Instantaneous power: \( P(t) = F(t)\, v(t) \)

### Tips
- Use the actual capture FPS for slow-motion videos (e.g., 240 Hz)
- Prefer normalized CSV for simplicity; pixel CSV is supported via scaling to meters
- Units: meters (m), seconds (s), Watts (W), Joules (J)
