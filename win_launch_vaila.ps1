    Description: Launches the vailá - Multimodal Toolbox using the Anaconda PowerShell Prompt on Windows 11.
                 The script activates the 'vaila' Conda environment and runs the vailá Python script.

    Usage:
      1. Open "Anaconda PowerShell Prompt" or PowerShell with Anaconda initialized.
      2. Run the script using: .\win_launch_vaila.ps1

    Features:
      - Activates the 'vaila' Conda environment.
      - Runs the vailá Python script from the new installation directory (AppData\Local\vaila).
      - Provides feedback to the user on progress and any issues encountered.

    Notes:
      - Ensure that Conda is installed and that the 'vaila' environment has been created during installation.
      - This script can be run from any PowerShell instance where Conda is initialized.
